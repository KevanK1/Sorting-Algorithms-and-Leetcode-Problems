## Sorting Algorithms

This section includes Java implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Each algorithm is implemented with detailed comments explaining its functionality and complexity analysis.

## LeetCode Problems

In this section, you'll find solutions to specific sorting-related problems from LeetCode. Each problem solution includes:

- Problem statement
- Approach and thought process
- Java code solution
- Explanation of the solution's efficiency and correctness

## Usage

To use any of the sorting algorithms or understand the solutions to LeetCode problems:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sorting-Algorithms-and-Leetcode-Problems.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the algorithm or problem you're interested in.

3. Review the Java code and accompanying explanations.
